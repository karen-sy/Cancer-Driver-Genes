Load in the "correct" genome and use that to generate the new maf.
To start don't worry about finding contexts of the mutations or indels. You can just do random snv mutations. 



So if the MAF file says that a C changed to a T randomly find another C in the "correct" gene sequence from the genome and change it to a T. 
Then use nt2aa to find what the new codon sequence is. 
If the new codon sequence matches the "correct" codon sequence it is a silent mutation, if it gives a stop then it is nonsense, otherwise it is a missense. 
You can also get the protein change from this. 
Do this for every mutation in the maf file and that counts as 1 permutation. 

This uses the same genome and driver genes that I sent in the previous email so use that genome as the "Correct" genome.
