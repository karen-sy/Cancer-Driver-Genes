1) Information

[immune escape] : regulate the cytokine/chemokine network, control the
recruitment of regulatory cells, modify the expression of receptors
for factors promoting tumor growth or release of vesicular bodies
which carry tumor-derived ‘‘molecular messages” throughout the
host system.

    (a) Regulatory T cells (Treg) are phenotypically defined as
CD4+CD25highFOXP3+ lymphocytes. Their function is to mediate suppression of 
effector T cells. They accumulate at tumor sites8, presumably in order to 
suppress anti-tumor immune responses. Treg are important in mediating 
inflammatory processes associated with cancer growth and cancer therapy. 
Whether the Treg-mediated regulation of inflammatory responses in cancer 
promotes or inhibits antitumor immunity is thus questionable.  ---> IN CODE: suppress 'recruitment'

    (b) Similar to Treg, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) 
also accumulate in the tumor microenvironment and suppress T-cell responses.
MDSC are bone marrow-derived immature myeloid cells that are increased in
frequency in the peripheral circulation, lymphoid organs and tumors of 
virtually all tumor-bearing hosts. They are recruited by tumor-derived 
soluble factors. These pro-inflammatory mediators induce tissue 
accumulations of MDSC and increase their suppressor activity thus favoring tumor growth. ---> IN CODE: suppress 'recruitment'

    (c) Tumor-induced apoptosis of activated T lymphocytes is yet another 
strategy used by tumors to escape from the host immune system. 
Tumors not only effectively escape from immune intervention by suppressing 
functions of T cells but also by actively inducing their apoptosis.
It has been reported that up to 90% of tumor-infiltrating 
T lymphocytes and substantial proportions of circulating CD8+ T cells 
in patients with cancer are undergoing apoptosis. Tumor-derived MV arrest
proliferation of activated T cells, down-regulate expression of 
TCR-associated zeta chain and Jak3 in T cells and, because they 
express FasL and/or TRAIL, induce apoptosis of activated T cells.
Thus, tumor-derived MV, but not MV derived from DC or T cells, 
can mediate a coordinated insult to cellular immunity, on the one hand
eliminating activated FasL+ T cells and on the other, supporting the expansion of Treg. 
Chronic inflammation promotes tumor growth by establishing an immunosuppressive
environment, blocking anti-tumor immunity and allowing the outgrowth of malignant cells.  ---> IN CODE: Death of immune cells (subtract from ode in terms of cancer #)

    (d) from other paper: tumors which lose MHC expression or acquire defects 
in antigen presentation may escape immune-mediated elimination by tumor-specific T cells.
....Leukocyte infiltration into tumor tissue and recognition of malignant 
cells is necessary for successful immune mediated elimination. Loss of 
antigenicity can arise due to the immune selection of cancer cells which 
lack or mutate immunogenic tumor antigens as well as through the 
acquisition of defects or deficiencies in antigen presentation (e.g. loss of
major histocompatibility (MHC) expression or dysregulation of antigen processing machinery) --> IN CODE: less 'sensitivity', or eliminate that param and merge this info into 'recruitment'
