% a2 : (1) Many of the genetic alterations in cancer abrogate the
% precise balance between differentiation and division, favoring
% the latter. This causes a selective growth advantage, because dif- ferentiating cells eventually die or become quiescent. 
% (2) cancer cells have evolved to tolerate genome complexity by acquiring mutations in genes such as TP53 (110)
% (3) driver genes that directly regulate the cell cycle or apoptosis are often mutated in cancers. 
%
% v2: (1) a gross chromosomal change favoring growth, such as a translocation or an extra chromosome, to survive and divide
% (2) tumor cells that can survive the dam- age will, by definition, have a selective growth advantage. 
% + genes can increase mutation acquisition rate
