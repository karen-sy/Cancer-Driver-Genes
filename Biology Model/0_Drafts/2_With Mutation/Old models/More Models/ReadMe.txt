In this folder / subfolders: 
0. Logistic growth (to contrast with L-V)
1. Lotka-Volterra Resource Carrying Capacity Model
2. Without Carrying Capacity (the one in Folder 1)   
3. Resource Capacity Model

*start without feedback from cancer / immune system. 

Objective: 
1. Evaluate each model
    i) at different initial states / parameter spaces
        a) Does it provide stable carrying capacity? 
        b) Is the dynamic of the system open to change when parameters are shifted? 
           (should be, even after reaching capacity; this is to enable modeling with SSA)
        c) Are normal/cancer dynamics realistic in their timeframe, population size, etc?
       (if immune is added?)
2.*****Construct final model that incorporates above features and 'pros' from each model
